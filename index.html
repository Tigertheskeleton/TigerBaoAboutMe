        <p>My career goals are different depending on how much I enjoy and do well in computer science. If I enjoy computer science and do well in it, I want to get a bachelor’s degree in math and a masters in computer science. Afterwards, I want to find a job in web or game development. If I don’t enjoy or do well in computer science, I want to get both a bachelor’s and master’s in math and get a job where math is a major component. I am interested in these careers because they are built off of math, my main strong suit in school, and seem like they could be enjoyable.

    <p>I have not had many accomplishments in high school so far, as I just started it, but I currently have As for most of my classes. I am part of an art club that is in the process of being formed/ joining another art club (I am not involved in dealing with that debacle). I also plan on trying out for the swim team in the coming spring.

    I have noticed from working with others that I can not lead a project, but will offer any support I can. My experience with art has shown me that I can be marvelously creative, and that I can learn new and complex things with enough determination and time. Several experiences in my life; such as drawing, everyday life, and more, have shown me my perfectionist side, and how I focus on the little details. My social life has shown how I can bond with all kinds of new people quickly, though I can be too shy to make the first move.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>All in all, I aim to get a job that is centered around math and/or computer science because of my experience with said subjects. Thank you for reading my about me page.
