        <p>My career goals are different depending on how much I enjoy and do well in computer science. If I enjoy computer science and do well in it, I want to get a bachelor’s degree in math and a masters in computer science. Afterwards, I want to find a job in web or game development. If I don’t enjoy or do well in computer science, I want to get both a bachelor’s and master’s in math and get a job where math is a major component. I am interested in these careers because they are built off of math, my main strong suit in school, and seem like they could be enjoyable.
